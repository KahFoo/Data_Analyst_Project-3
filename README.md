### Project Description:

The Director-General of the World Health Organization announced on May 4, 2023, that COVID-19 has evolved from a global public health emergency to an ongoing health concern. As a junior data analyst committed to learning, I've chosen to undertake a capstone project which is to create a imformative construct a Power BI dashboard that would facilitate the study and analysis of the most recent COVID-19 trends and vaccination rates. The goal of this endeavor is to investigate if the current data supports this new categorization of the COVID-19 predicament.

For this capstone project, I utilized the dataset from Our World in Data (OWID) to assemble the dashboard, with a particular focus on vaccination status across various countries and continents. This focus is intended to evaluate whether herd immunity has been accomplished on a global scale. Also, the GDP of each country is incorporated into the analysis to ascertain if a nation's economic status has an impact on its vaccination program.

### Dashboard Findings:

Based on the dashboard analysis:

Globally, almost 70% of the population has been vaccinated (received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine), while 64% are fully vaccinated (received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine). This indeed still far from the 95% vaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity. 

but only 29.9% of individuals in low-income countries have received at least one dose. As of mid-May 2023, there were approximately 2.6 million new cases and overwith 64 percent 17,000 deaths reported globally in the last 28 days. However, this represented a decline of 14% and 26% respectively, in comparison to the previous 28-day period. .
